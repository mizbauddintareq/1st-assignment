            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I, Ms. Tana Ray, Internationally renowned, multi-Michelin chef have opened a string of successful
                restaurants across the globe, from the UK and France to Singapore and the United States. As a very
                common phenomenon, we're always afraid of healthy food. Because we usually never find them being too
                tasty. That's why,I try to add a homely vibe in every dish I make & sensibly also maintain the taste
                with maintaining healthy amount of every food component. I actually have a great determination for
                giving you some incredibly healthy but tasty food by FOOD CLUB.</p>

                    <h2>Chicken Fajitas</h2>
                    <p>The word "fajita" means "little belt" from "faja" for strip or belt, and the diminutive "ita." It
                        describes a skirt steak, and fajitas were traditionally made with grilled skirt steak, though
                        now they can be made with chicken, shrimp, you name it.</p>

                    <h2>Lemon Ricotta Fritters</h2>
                    <p>These mouthwatering fritters are golden brown outside, soft and cakelike inside, and have a
                        lovely citrusy and creamy flavor from the classic duo: lemon ricotta. Fritters are great served
                        warm with jam or honey.</p>

                    <h2>Spaghetti Allâ€™Amatriciana</h2>
                    <p>Spaghetti All'Amatriciana is a traditional Italian dish that reminds me of my experience in
                        Italy. This amatriciana sauce recipe features guanciale (dried pork cheek). Guanciale can be
                        hard to find, but pancetta or thick-cut bacon are good substitutes.</p>
